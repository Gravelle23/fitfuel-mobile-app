# FitFuel Mobile (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

## Overview
FitFuel is a mobile-first workout log built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add workouts with a category and notes, search and filter their history, edit or delete entries, and switch between light and dark mode. Workouts are saved using `localStorage` so the data persists after refreshing the page.

## Features
- Add workouts (name, category, optional notes)
- View workout history (second HTML page)
- Search workouts by text
- Filter workouts by category
- Edit workouts in a modal
- Delete individual workouts
- Clear all workouts
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Stats dashboard (total workouts, top category, last workout date)
- Persistent storage with `localStorage`

## Pages
- `index.html` – main page for adding workouts and viewing the list
- `history.html` – history-focused page for searching/filtering and reviewing workouts

Both pages are populated dynamically by JavaScript using the same saved data.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Browser `localStorage`

## How to Run
Option 1 (simplest):
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

Option 2 (recommended):
1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Use the Live Server extension to run `index.html`
