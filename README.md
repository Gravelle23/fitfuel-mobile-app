Overview

FitFuel Mobile is a workout tracking application designed to help users log exercises, organize their training sessions, and monitor workout activity over time. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can add workouts with categories and notes, search and filter past entries, and view summary statistics such as total workouts and top workout categories.

Users can enter a workout name, select a category, and optionally include notes. Each workout is saved and displayed in a dynamic list. The history page allows users to review previous entries, filter by workout type, and edit or delete existing records. The application also includes a dark/light theme toggle and maintains data persistence so workouts remain stored even after the app is closed.

The purpose of creating this application was to strengthen my ability to design interactive user interfaces, manage application state, work with persistent data storage, and understand how web technologies can be integrated into a mobile application environment. This project helped me connect front-end development skills with mobile deployment tools and workflows.
